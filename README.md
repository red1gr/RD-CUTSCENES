# RD-CUTSCENES

RD-CUTSCENES IS A CURATED COLLECTION OF GTA V CUTSCENE NAMES.
IT PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF CUTSCENE IDENTIFIERS FROM THE GAME, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR MODDING, CINEMATIC TOOLS, OR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES.

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS ONLY CUTSCENE NAMES — NO SCRIPTS OR GAME ASSETS.

---

## OVERVIEW

THE CUTSCENE NAMES FOLLOW GTA V’S INTERNAL NAMING CONVENTIONS. THEY CAN BE USED TO:

* TRIGGER CUTSCENES IN MODS OR CUSTOM TOOLS
* REFERENCE CUTSCENES FOR ANIMATIONS OR CINEMATIC SEQUENCES
* BUILD LISTS, DROPDOWNS, OR SEARCH FEATURES IN DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

---

## EXAMPLES OF CUTSCENE NAMES
```
ABIGAIL_MCS_1_CONCAT
ABIGAIL_MCS_2
AC_IG_3_P3_B
AH_1_EXT_T6
AH_1_INT
AH_1_MCS_1
AH_2_EXT_ALT
APA_FIN_CEL_APT3
...
```
MORE CUTSCENES CAN BE ADDED AS THEY ARE DISCOVERED.

## USAGE

WHILE THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS NO EXECUTABLE CODE, THE CUTSCENE NAMES CAN BE USED IN:

* MODDING TOOLS AS IDENTIFIERS FOR TRIGGERING CUTSCENES
* DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR ANIMATION TIMING, CINEMATIC SEQUENCES, OR STORYBOARDS
* REFERENCE PURPOSES FOR CATALOGING AND ORGANIZING CUTSCENES
